You need to follow a simple structure pattern:

- Every new component need to have it's specific folder, this folder need to be named as the component name;
- The component folder need the component file itself and an `index.js` file that export that component;
- You need to import and export that component on `index.js` that are on components folder;
- Every new component need to have its own story file;
- When you finish your work, you'll need to commit with messages following [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) pattern. The easiest way to do this is running

  ```sh
  $ yarn run commit
  ```
  
  from within the root of this repository;
